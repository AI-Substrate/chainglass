## Companion Findings — Disposition Table

| Finding ID | ackOf (review-request task) | Severity | Disposition | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F001 | T004 (01KQPDR5EP9VDWAJ696Z7F3QSK) | MEDIUM | **fixed** | Test only locked `view===` before `selectedFile?` — added `currentDir?` ordering assertion in BOTH render points. A future refactor putting `currentDir?` ahead of the feed branch would now fail the test. Re-ran 7/7. |
| F002 | T007 (01KQPE21WEFZ0SXC54PMSB8V75) | MEDIUM | **fixed** | `id="feed-card-title-${item.path}"` broke `aria-labelledby` IDREF tokenization for paths with whitespace (e.g. `output/my render.png`). Replaced with React `useId()` — stable, valid, path-independent. |
| F003 | T008 (01KQPE56A5JA0HYQW68ZQC7A67) | MEDIUM | **fixed** | `AudioPreview` rendered `<audio preload="metadata">` eagerly — N audio cards triggered N simultaneous metadata fetches at mount. Wrapped in `useLazyLoad` mirroring `VideoPreview` pattern; placeholder until visible. Keeps AC G2 in-flight-media bound consistent. |
| F001 (run 2) | T012 (01KQR4634AAVGSE6991GZRVVKG) | **HIGH** | **fixed** | `handleToggleFilter` started from `ALL_CATEGORIES` (all 7 chips active) and clicking 'image' dropped 'all' from the set, then deleted 'image' (it was still present), leaving every category EXCEPT image active — opposite of intent. Fix: when `prev.has('all')` and a non-all chip is clicked, return `new Set([cat])` for a fresh single-category selection. Workshop §5 semantics restored. T024 will lock this with a dedicated predicate test. |
| F002 (run 2) | T014 (01KQR4C91FEJVCS7EJJKZE8TVK) | MEDIUM | **fixed** | Original Case 4 test (mid-list) didn't actually lock list-extension behavior — a broken impl that never extended would still pass. **Two fixes**: (a) impl now stops at sibling **top-level** list markers (not nested ones) so item integrity is preserved, not the whole list; (b) test rewritten to `maxLines: 3` boundary on the marker line and asserts `also wraps here.` IN, `Third item.` OUT — would fail if list-extension was removed. Plus a continuation-boundary case for thoroughness. 11/11 tests pass. |
| HMR-001 | T016 (user dev-server bundle error) | **HIGH (runtime)** | **fixed** | Turbopack flagged `node:fs/promises` as unsupported in the app-client chunk. Cause: `use-recent-feed-state.ts` (client) imported `detectFeedItemKind` from `services/recent-feed-items.ts` — which transitively pulled in `node:fs/promises` via the `stat` import. **Fix**: extracted the kind-detection logic into a browser-safe `apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/lib/feed-item-kind.ts`. Both server (`recent-feed-items.ts`) and client (`use-recent-feed-state.ts`) now import from `lib/`. Server file re-exports `detectFeedItemKind` for backwards-compat with existing test imports. 51/51 affected tests still green; tsc clean. |

**Companion run 1 farewell** — `2026-05-03T17-52-52-872Z-c76e` (`exitReason: idle_budget`, 9 tasks reviewed, 3 findings sent, 0 unresolved). Run 2 boots after these fixes for T012+.

**Companion run 2** — `2026-05-04T09-48-40-912Z-0b20` (active). Re-briefed with T001-T011 + F001-F003 fix context. First ping: FX-companion-findings (976487d1) for verification.

### T012 — Seed orchestrator + getRecentFeedItems service

Created **`services/recent-feed-items.ts`** (new — outside original Domain Manifest, added post-implementation):
- `getRecentFeedItems(worktreePath, limit)` wraps `getRecentFiles` + parallel `fs.stat` (`Promise.allSettled` so a stat failure on one path doesn't blank the seed) + extension → `FeedItemKind` mapping.
- Returns `{ ok: true; items: FeedItem[] } | { ok: false; error: 'not-git' }`.
- Exports `detectFeedItemKind(filename)` so T024's filter predicate (and any future caller) can reuse the same mapping.

Added **`fetchRecentFeedItems` server action** in `app/actions/file-actions.ts` mirroring the `fetchRecentFiles` pattern (`requireAuth` + dynamic import).

Replaced **`recent-feed-view.tsx`** stub body with the seeded orchestrator:
- State: `items`, `isLoading`, `seedError`, `isPaused`, `activeFilters` (`ReadonlySet<FilterCategory>` initialised to all 7 categories).
- `loadSeed` calls the server action; surfaces seed errors to `<FeedErrorState>` (with retry).
- `handleToggleFilter` implements workshop §5 semantics: clicking 'all' snaps back to all; clicking any other chip drops 'all' from the set; emptying the subset auto-snaps back to 'all' (so users always see content).
- Render dispatch by `item.kind` → ImagePreview / VideoPreview / AudioPreview / BinaryPreview. Markdown + Code currently fall through to BinaryPreview — replaced at T021/T022.
- Header / filters / states wired from the static UI primitives (T009-T011).
- `role="feed"` + `aria-busy={isLoading}` on the root container — AC H1 baseline.
- Bridge events `recent-feed:open-file` and `recent-feed:open-settings` dispatched as placeholders for T025 (action hook) and T028 (settings sheet) — keeps T012 self-contained.
- Close button absolutely-positioned top-right (opacity-0 default) for AC A1 hover-to-dismiss; primary close path is the entrypoint button toggling the URL param (T029).

**Decision — relative import path**: `'../../../../../app/actions/file-actions'` (5 `../`s). The `@/` alias maps only to `apps/web/src/`, but the actions file lives in `apps/web/app/`. Same pattern browser-client.tsx uses (4 `../`s from its location).

**Decision — bridge events vs prop drilling**: T025 will replace the `window.dispatchEvent` calls with `useFeedActions()` hook. For T012 the events keep the orchestrator decoupled from the URL-param logic that lives one level up in browser-client.tsx — T025 lifts that into a proper hook.

**Evidence**: `tsc --noEmit` clean for `recent-feed-view.tsx`, `recent-feed-items.ts`, and the updated `file-actions.ts`.

### T013 — Real-git integration test for seed

`test/integration/web/recent-feed-seed.integration.test.ts` — 17 tests across 2 suites (4 + 13 parameterized extension cases). All pass in 530ms.

**Real-git scenarios** (4 tests):
1. AC B1 — newest-first ordering: 3 commits in known order; assert `result.items[0..2]` paths match the reverse-chronological commit sequence; verify `kind`, `size`, `changedAt`, `eventType='changed'`, `absolutePath`, `name` are all populated.
2. AC B2 — limit honored: 8 commits with `limit=3` returns the 3 newest only.
3. AC B3 — non-git workspace: bare temp dir (no `git init`) → `{ ok: false, error: 'not-git' }`.
4. Stat-failure resilience: commit `survivor.ts` and `doomed.ts`, then `rmSync` doomed.ts post-commit. Result: survivor returns, doomed silently dropped (validates `Promise.allSettled` resilience design).

**Extension dispatch matrix** (13 parameterized cases via `it.each`): photo.png→image, screencast.mp4→video, voice.mp3→audio, notes.md→markdown, notes.MARKDOWN→markdown (case-insensitive), module.ts→code, component.tsx→code, script.py→code, Dockerfile→code (no extension), Makefile→code, archive.tar→binary, data.bin→binary, somefile-no-ext→generic.

**Decision** — used `execFileSync` for git ops in test harness (vs `simple-git` or any other library). No new test deps; same approach the codebase uses elsewhere.

**Decision** — `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` etc set via env per call to keep tests hermetic (no dependence on host's git config). `commit.gpgsign=false` prevents the test from hanging on a signing key prompt if the host is configured for signed commits.

**Constitution P4 honored**: zero `vi.mock` calls, zero own-domain mocks. Real binary, real fs, real return path.

**Evidence**: `npx vitest run test/integration/web/recent-feed-seed.integration.test.ts` → 17/17 pass in 1.03s total (529ms test execution).

### T014 — TDD truncateMarkdown utility

`apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/lib/truncate-markdown.ts` + `test/unit/web/features/041-file-browser/lib/truncate-markdown.test.ts`. 10/10 tests pass in 2ms.

**Algorithm**:
1. Empty / whitespace-only input → `''`.
2. Strip leading YAML front matter (handles CRLF; trims leading whitespace after closing `---`).
3. If body is now empty (front-matter-only doc) → `''`.
4. Single overlong line case (lines.length===1 OR all-but-first are blank) → truncate at maxChars + `…`.
5. Walk lines counting non-empty-lines + total chars; track fence parity (`insideFence`); break when either limit fires.
6. **Case 3 fix-up** — if stopped inside a fence, extend to closing fence (or EOF if unterminated; doesn't loop).
7. **Case 4 fix-up** — if stopped on a list-item line OR an indented continuation of one, extend through subsequent indented/marker lines until blank line or top-level prose.
8. Return joined output trimmed.

**Tests** (10):
- 6 binding cases per Finding 06 (front-matter-only / FM+prose / mid-fence / mid-list / overlong line / empty input).
- 4 invariants: maxLines counts non-empty only; full-body short docs return without ellipsis; CRLF normalises; unterminated fence does not throw or loop.

**Decision** — `maxLines` counts non-empty lines (matches typical "show me 8 lines of content" UX, not "8 lines including blank separators"). Documented in JSDoc.

**Decision** — character cap is "rough" — fence/list extension can blow past it. Trade-off: never split a fenced code block (broken markdown render). The feed's settings (T028) cap excerpt size with a hard ceiling separately if needed.

**Decision** — front-matter regex `/^---\r?\n([\s\S]*?)\r?\n---\r?\n?/` is intentionally narrow (must start at byte 0, must be paired with closing `---` on its own line). Avoids matching `---` separators mid-document.

**Plan path correction**: existing convention is `test/unit/web/features/041-file-browser/lib/...` (with `features/` segment), not `test/unit/web/041-file-browser/lib/...`. Plan task row updated.

**Evidence**: `npx vitest run` 10/10 green, 2ms test execution.

### T015 — TDD live-merge reducer (`useRecentFeedState`)

`apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/components/recent-feed/hooks/use-recent-feed-state.ts` + `test/unit/web/features/041-file-browser/recent-feed/use-recent-feed-state.test.ts`. **34/34 tests pass in 3ms.**

**Reducer actions** (8 types — `FeedAction`):
- `INIT` — seed items, drop dismissed + filtered, cap at ceiling.
- `EVENT_BATCH` — process N events: filter at intake (addDir/unlinkDir + build-artifact paths), then merge each event with promote/insert/delete semantics; ceiling enforcement at the end. Single dispatch per burst.
- `PAUSE` / `RESUME` — RESUME drains buffer in arrival order (oldest-first iteration over buffer reversed) so the newest buffered event lands at items[0].
- `CLEAR_DELETED` — auto-removal timer fires; only removes a path that's in the deleted state (idempotent).
- `SET_CEILING` — re-trim items if exceeded.
- `SET_DISCONNECTED` — UI banner toggle (T019).
- `DISMISS` — adds to dismissed set, removes from items + buffer, blocks future events for that path.

**Filtering** (Findings 06 + 10):
- `isIntakeFiltered`: `addDir`/`unlinkDir` events dropped (Finding 10); build-artifact paths dropped (Finding 06 — Risk M2 in validation).
- `isFilteredPath` matches `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.turbo/`, `.cache/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/` as path PREFIX or after `/` separator. Substring matches (`build-tools/`, `notes-distinct/`) intentionally do NOT trigger — verified in 13 parameterized cases.

**Buffer coalescence during PAUSE**: multiple events for the same path collapse to one entry — newest wins. So `add` → `change` → `unlink` for a single file during a pause buffers as a single deleted entry, not three.

**Burst coalescing (AC G3)**: the reducer guarantees one dispatch per `EVENT_BATCH`. The hook layer (`useRecentFeedState`) batches raw `pushEvent(...)` calls onto the next animation frame (or microtask in jsdom), so 50 raw events fired synchronously result in one rAF, one EVENT_BATCH, one render. Pure reducer is deterministic: `events.length === 50` ⇒ exactly one state transition.

**Decision** — exported `isFilteredPath` and `isIntakeFiltered` so T017's integration test can lock the same predicate without re-deriving it. Future `.gitignore`-aware filter swap-in (workshop §11 Q6 follow-up) lands in this single function.

**Decision** — `pushEvent` always queues on rAF/microtask, never dispatches synchronously. Even a single event pays the 16ms latency cost in exchange for guaranteed coalescing of any concurrent events. Trade-off: visible promotion is slightly delayed (16ms) but burst behavior is deterministic.

**Decision** — `eventToFeedItem` reuses `detectFeedItemKind` from `services/recent-feed-items.ts` (extension dispatch). Single source of truth for kind classification across seed + live merge.

**Test coverage** (34):
- `isFilteredPath`: 13 cases (positive matches, nested matches, substring negatives).
- `isIntakeFiltered`: 3 cases (addDir/unlinkDir/file).
- `INIT`: 2 cases (seed with dismissed/filtered drop, ceiling cap).
- `EVENT_BATCH`: 7 cases (promote/insert/unlink/dir-filter/artifact-filter/50-event-burst/ceiling-eviction).
- Dismissed-path block.
- `PAUSE`/`RESUME`: drain order, intra-buffer coalescence.
- `CLEAR_DELETED`/`SET_CEILING`/`DISMISS`: 3 cases.

**Evidence**: `npx vitest run` 34/34 in 3ms.

### T016 — Wire useRecentFeedState to useFileChanges('*')

Replaced the orchestrator's `useState<FeedItem[]>` with `useRecentFeedState` (T015 reducer + rAF-batched pushEvent). Subscribed to `useFileChanges('*', { debounce: 50 })` from `_platform/events/045-live-file-events` — Finding 01 binding: NO new SSE channel/broadcaster/route added.

Effect: when `changes` array updates, walk it and push only events whose timestamp exceeds `lastSeenTsRef.current` to avoid double-counting on re-render. Each FileChange → RawFileChangeEvent shape (path, kind=eventType, absolutePath via `joinPath`, mtimeMs from SSE timestamp, size=0 — next seed refresh repopulates).

Pause/refresh wiring: header buttons dispatch `PAUSE`/`RESUME` to the reducer; refresh re-runs `loadSeed`. The `bufferedChanges` count surfaces in the header live-indicator copy ("Paused (3)") — workshop §5.

**Decision** — pattern is `'*'` not `'**'`. The plan task said `useFileChanges('**')` but the existing hub's JSDoc + path-matcher use `'*'` as the watch-everything wildcard ("Watch everything (for changes sidebar)"). Plan task row updated.

**Decision** — `path-browserify` not in deps; replaced with inline `joinPath(worktreePath, relPath)` helper. Browser-safe, sufficient for clipboard/display use case (no `..` resolution needed since server gives normalised relative paths).

**Decision** — `lastSeenTsRef` deduplication: `useFileChanges` 'replace' mode emits the same batch on each render until a newer batch arrives. Tracking the max-seen timestamp per render pass keeps each event from being pushed twice. The reducer's intake filter (`isIntakeFiltered`) is a second-line guard, but timestamp tracking is cheaper than re-running the dedup at the merge layer.

**Decision** — debounce 50ms on the SSE hook. Aggregates micro-bursts into one batch handed to the rAF queue. Total time-to-render: ≤ 50ms (debounce) + ≤ 16ms (rAF) ≈ 66ms worst-case. Acceptable per AC G3 (50 events → ≤ 3 renders) and well under the workshop's 200ms perceived-latency budget.

**Evidence**: tsc clean. AC C1/C2 covered. Live integration verification lands at T017 (real fs.watch + real SSE).

### T017 — Real fs.watch + real reducer integration test

`test/integration/web/recent-feed-live-updates.integration.test.ts` — 5 tests pass in 523ms. Constitution P4 honored (zero `vi.mock`).

**Scope decision**: this test covers the file-browser-side live-update pipeline (real fs.watch → real recentFeedReducer). The HTTP/SSE round-trip (server FileChangeHub → SSEManager → client EventSource → useFileChanges) is owned by Plan 045's existing integration tests; reproducing it here would require booting Next.js dev server (heavy, slow, brittle). The file-browser-side contract — *given a stream of file events, does the feed merge them correctly?* — is what this plan introduces and what this test locks.

**Tests** (5):
1. **AC C1** — real fs.watch fires for `writeFileSync` of a new file + modify of an existing one; reducer promotes/inserts correctly; no duplicates from in-place mutation.
2. **AC G3** — 50 rapid `writeFileSync` calls produce ≥ 50 fs events; one `EVENT_BATCH` dispatch handles the burst as a single state transition (reference inequality on items proves a single transition occurred).
3. **AC C2 noise control** — creating files under `node_modules/` and `.next/` produces real fs events that the reducer rejects at intake; only the `real.ts` source file lands in items.
4. **Filter cross-check** — verifies `isFilteredPath` matches the same patterns the unit suite asserts (single source of truth across unit + integration boundaries).
5. **Live-after-seed compatibility** — initialises a real git repo (mirrors T013 setup), seeds the reducer, then dispatches a live `add` event; new entry lands on top, seed remains intact.

**Decision** — recursive `fs.watch` works on macOS/Windows (the harness runs on macOS). Linux would need a different setup, but that's not the deployment target. Documented inline.

**Decision** — applyEvents helper synthesises `RawFileChangeEvent`s from real fs events with `size: 100, mtimeMs: Date.now()` (since fs.watch doesn't carry that metadata). The reducer doesn't care about those values for ordering; only `path` + `kind` are load-bearing.

**Decision** — used `--no-gpg-sign` flag on git commit (in addition to `commit.gpgsign=false` config) belt-and-braces against host signing setups. Plan 084 noted this same workaround.

**Evidence**: `npx vitest run test/integration/web/recent-feed-live-updates.integration.test.ts` → 5/5 pass in 901ms total.

### T018-T019 — Pause buffer pill + SSE-disconnect banner

Both UI affordances landed in `recent-feed-view.tsx` as small additions:

**T018 buffer pill** — sticky button rendered when `state.paused && state.buffer.length > 0`:
- "N new {change|changes} — click to show"
- Click dispatches `RESUME` → reducer drains buffer in arrival order (T015 logic).
- Sticky `top-0 z-20` so it stays visible while scrolling. Workshop §5.
- Header pause/resume button already wired to PAUSE/RESUME at T016.

**T019 disconnect banner** — `state.isDisconnected` driven by `useSSEConnectionState()` from `_platform/events` (Plan 045 — existing primitive, no new code needed). When `connectionState !== 'connected'` we dispatch `SET_DISCONNECTED: true`; reverts when reconnected. Banner uses amber accent with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` for SR users; copy: "Live updates disconnected — existing items preserved; reconnecting…" Reducer never blanks `items` on disconnect (AC C5 binding).

**Decision** — pill placement is INSIDE the scroll container so it doesn't overlap the header. The header itself already shows "Paused (3)" in the live indicator (T016) — the pill is the action affordance, the header is the status read-out.

**Decision** — disconnect banner is OUTSIDE the scroll container (above the filter chips) so it stays visible regardless of scroll position. Workshop §7.

**Evidence**: tsc clean. Live behavior verifiable via T035 harness exercise (visual smoke at default + mobile).

### T020 — file-excerpt server action with security gating

`apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/services/file-excerpt.ts` + `test/unit/web/features/041-file-browser/services/file-excerpt.test.ts`. **32/32 tests pass in 11ms.**

Server action `fetchFileExcerpt(worktreePath, filePath, mode)` registered in `app/actions/file-actions.ts` (resolves `IFileSystem` + `IPathResolver` from the DI container; same pattern as readFile/saveFile).

**Security gating** (per validation Risk M1, ordered):
1. **Secrets-pattern reject** (BEFORE path resolution): `.env*`, `credentials`, `*.secret*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa*`, `**/.git/**`. Returns `'forbidden'`.
2. **Path-traversal guard**: `pathResolver.resolvePath(worktreePath, filePath)` throws `PathSecurityError`. Returns `'security'`.
3. **Existence + directory guard**: not-found.
4. **Content-type gate**: only `markdown` and `code` (via `detectFeedItemKind`); also a belt-and-braces check via `detectContentType` to reject `image`/`video`/`audio`/`pdf`. Returns `'forbidden'`.
5. **Size guard for full mode**: 256KB hard cap. Excerpt mode unbounded (output capped by `truncateMarkdown` / first-N-lines truncation regardless of input size).
6. **Read** then **null-byte sniff** (first 8KB): catches binary content with text-y extension. Returns `'forbidden'`.

**Tests** (32):
- `isSecretsPath` parameterized: 19 cases (14 reject + 5 pass-through). Distinguishes `credentials.json` (reject) from `credentials-overview.md` (pass) — basename-anchored regex.
- Service: 13 tests using real `NodeFileSystemAdapter` + `PathResolverAdapter` against `mkdtempSync` temp dirs:
  - markdown excerpt + truncation applied
  - code excerpt + detected language + first-N-lines cap
  - full mode returns full content
  - `.env` rejected
  - `config/credentials` rejected
  - `../../etc/passwd` path-traversal rejected
  - PNG / MP4 / MP3 binary types rejected
  - null-byte content rejected even with `.ts` extension
  - missing file → not-found
  - directory → not-found
  - 257KB file in full mode → too-large
  - 300KB markdown in excerpt mode → succeeds (output truncated)

**Decision** — JSDoc near the top initially used `**/credentials*` literal, which closed the JSDoc block prematurely (TS1160). Replaced with prose description; SECRETS_PATTERNS regex remains the single source of truth. Future readers should not edit the JSDoc to use raw `*/` sequences.

**Decision** — secrets-pattern check is the FIRST gate (before path-resolution). A clever attacker could pass `worktreePath/../.env` — the path-resolver catches the traversal but the pattern check catches the suspicious filename first regardless. Defense in depth.

**Decision** — null-byte sniff after read uses the same 8KB window as `readFileAction` for consistency.

**Constitution P4 honored**: zero `vi.mock`. Real Node adapters; real fs against temp dirs.

**Evidence**: `npx vitest run` 32/32 in 11ms.

### T021-T023 — Markdown / code / deleted preview cards

Three new files under `previews/`. RecentFeedView updated to dispatch on `kind` AND `eventType==='deleted'`:

- **`markdown-excerpt-card.tsx`** — useLazyLoad + fetchFileExcerpt('excerpt'). Renders truncated markdown as `<pre>` whitespace-pre-wrap with fade-out gradient. Loading / error / ready states. Full markdown rendering (Mermaid + Shiki + tables) deferred to v1.x — workshop §2 binding visual treatment honored (excerpt + gradient).
- **`code-excerpt-card.tsx`** — symmetric to markdown but with `whitespace-pre overflow-x-auto` and `data-language={lang}`. Shiki HTML rendering deferred — server returns raw text bounded by codeLines (default 12).
- **`deleted-preview.tsx`** — strikethrough mini-card with Trash2 icon. `useEffect` timer fires `onClearDeleted(path)` after `deletedWindowMs` (default 5000ms). `Infinity` disables the timer ("Until dismissed" setting per workshop §9). Orchestrator dispatches `CLEAR_DELETED` to the reducer (T015) which removes the deleted entry.

RecentFeedView dispatch updated:
- `eventType === 'deleted'` short-circuits to DeletedPreview regardless of kind.
- `kind === 'markdown'` → MarkdownExcerptCard.
- `kind === 'code'` → CodeExcerptCard.
- Other kinds unchanged (image/video/audio/binary).

**Decision** — Mermaid/Shiki rendering deferred. Reasons: (1) v1 ships excerpts as text — workshop §2 says "fade-out gradient hinting more content"; users click-to-open for full rendering. (2) Adding Mermaid+Shiki to every excerpt card would re-trigger the cold-start latency Finding 12 already flagged. (3) FileViewerPanel already does full rendering — single place to maintain.

**Decision** — fetchFileExcerpt called from inside the card (per-card fetch on viewport entry) rather than batched at the orchestrator level. Trade-off: more server round-trips but each fires only when the card scrolls into view. content-visibility:auto + useLazyLoad keep this bounded.

**Decision** — DeletedPreview takes `onClearDeleted` callback rather than `dispatch` directly, so it stays a dumb component. Orchestrator wires the dispatch.

**Plan path note** — relative-import depth from `previews/` to `app/actions/` is 6 `../`s (one deeper than from `recent-feed/`). Verified via `realpath`.

**Evidence**: tsc clean across all 4 modified files.

### T024 — Filter predicate + toggle extraction + tests

Extracted the inline filter logic from `recent-feed-view.tsx` into a testable lib module `apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/lib/feed-filter.ts`:

- `ALL_FILTER_CATEGORIES` — canonical all-inclusive set, exported by reference identity (so `=== ALL_FILTER_CATEGORIES` is a meaningful state check).
- `feedItemCategory(item)` — `FeedItemKind` → `FilterCategory` mapping. `binary` + `generic` both bucket under `'other'`.
- `itemMatchesFilter(item, active)` — predicate.
- `toggleFilterCategory(prev, cat)` — pure state-machine transition function.

`recent-feed-view.tsx` now imports and delegates — orchestrator no longer carries the filter logic in body.

**Tests** (18, 2ms total):
- 7 cases for `feedItemCategory` mapping (all 7 kinds → their categories; binary/generic → 'other').
- 3 cases for `itemMatchesFilter` (all-pass, subset-restrict, other-bucket).
- 8 cases for `toggleFilterCategory` covering workshop §5 + F001 fix:
  - 'All' click from any state → snap to all-inclusive.
  - **F001 LOCK**: from all-inclusive, click non-All → fresh single-chip subset (NOT delete-from-all).
  - Subset add when chip not active.
  - Subset remove when chip active.
  - Empty subset auto-snaps to all-inclusive.
  - Input set never mutated.
  - Multi-step "All → Image → Video" → {image, video}.
  - Multi-step "Image → empty → All" → all-inclusive.

The F001 fix is now locked — a regression to the previous broken implementation would fail the explicit "fresh single-chip subset" assertion that calls out the 'NOT every-category-except-image' invariant.

**Evidence**: `npx vitest run` 18/18 in 2ms.

### T025 — useFeedActions hook (9 catalog actions)

`apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/components/recent-feed/hooks/use-feed-actions.ts` — implements every workshop §3 catalog action:

1. **`open(path)`** — calls caller-supplied `onOpenFile` (browser-client wires `setParams({ file, view: null, line: null })`).
2. **`copyRelativePath(path)`** — `navigator.clipboard.writeText(path)` + toast.success.
3. **`copyAbsolutePath(path)`** — looks up the FeedItem in `items` for its absolutePath, writes to clipboard.
4. **`download(path)`** — `window.open(rawFileUrl + '&download=true')`.
5. **`copyFilename(path)`** — basename only.
6. **`copyMarkdownLink(path)`** — `![name](url)` for image/video/audio kinds; `[name](url)` for everything else. Uses raw-file URL.
7. **`revealInTree(path)`** — calls caller-supplied `onRevealInTree` (browser-client wires `setParams({ dir, file, view: null })`).
8. **`copyFileContents(path)`** — async; fetches via `fetchFileExcerpt(worktreePath, path, 'full')` (T020 server action — same security gating + 256KB cap). Falls back to toast.error on `forbidden`/`security`/`not-found`/`too-large`.
9. **`dismiss(path)`** — dispatches `{ type: 'DISMISS', path }` to the T015 reducer (adds to dismissed set, removes from items + buffer, blocks future events).

Orchestrator change: removed inline `handleCopyRel`/`handleCopyAbs`/`handleDownload`/`handleOpenItem` and replaced with `useFeedActions({ slug, worktreePath, items, dispatch, onOpenFile, onRevealInTree })`. CardActions now consumes the hook directly.

`browser-client.tsx` wires the navigation handlers:
- `onOpenFile={(path) => setParams({ file: path, view: null, line: null }, { history: 'push' })}` — clears `view` AND `line` (so the file opens fresh, not at a previously-set scroll line).
- `onRevealInTree={(path) => { const idx = path.lastIndexOf('/'); const dir = idx === -1 ? '' : path.slice(0, idx); setParams({ dir, file: path, view: null }, { history: 'push' }); }}` — sets dir + file + clears view.

**Decision** — `onOpenFile` and `onRevealInTree` are OPTIONAL props on `RecentFeedView`. When not provided (e.g., a future popout/standalone usage), the orchestrator falls back to the bridge events (`recent-feed:open-file`, `recent-feed:reveal-in-tree`) so it remains operable in non-browser-client contexts. Browser-client always supplies them — bridge events are never fired in production.

**Decision** — `copyFileContents` returns `Promise<void>`; the caller `await`s for error handling. The other 8 actions are sync (clipboard.writeText returns a promise but we don't await it for those — fire-and-forget with toast feedback).

**Evidence**: tsc clean for `use-feed-actions.ts`, `recent-feed-view.tsx`, `browser-client.tsx`. The two pre-existing errors at browser-client lines 516-517 (`fileNav.fileData?.content`) are unchanged from before T025.

### T026-T027 — Keyboard nav + ARIA/reduced-motion/contrast

**T026 — `use-feed-keyboard.ts`**:

Per-card focus resolution: walks up from `document.activeElement` looking for `data-feed-card-path`. FeedCard sets that data attribute + `tabIndex={0}` to be focusable. Returns a single `onKeyDown` handler the orchestrator attaches at the feed-root level.

Shortcuts (workshop §3 + AC H2):
- ArrowUp / ArrowDown — navigate (wraps; uses `CSS.escape` for selector safety since paths can contain `.`).
- Enter — invoke `actions.open` on focused card.
- `c` — copyRelativePath; `C` (Shift+C) — copyAbsolutePath; `d` — download; `r` — revealInTree; `m` — copyMarkdownLink.
- Modifier-key check (`!metaKey && !ctrlKey && !altKey`) so the letters don't intercept browser shortcuts (Cmd+R reload, Cmd+D bookmark).
- Input/textarea/select tag check skips intercept when user is typing.

**T027 — ARIA + reduced-motion**:

- Orchestrator: `role="feed"` + `aria-label="Recent changes"` + `aria-busy={state.isLoading}` (AC H1).
- FeedCard: `role="article"` already set in T007 (with biome ignore + rationale). T027 adds `tabIndex={0}` and `data-feed-card-path` to support T026 keyboard nav. `focus:outline-2 focus:outline-ring focus:outline-offset-2` for visible focus ring; `motion-reduce:transition-none` Tailwind variant disables hover lift/scale (AC H5).
- Polite live region (sr-only): announces newly added items via `aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="false"`. Currently fires when items[0] has `eventType==='added'` — could be refined to fire only on TRANSITIONS in v1.x but covers AC H3 baseline.
- Contrast: event-badge colors set in T007 use `bg-{color}-500/10` + dark mode `text-{color}-400`/light mode `text-{color}-700` — meets WCAG AA in both themes by Tailwind defaults. Path label uses `text-muted-foreground` (existing system value, contrast verified by codebase precedent).

**Decision** — kept the disconnect banner OUTSIDE the role="feed" container so SR users hear "Recent changes feed, busy" (orchestrator) AND the disconnect status independently rather than the banner being part of the feed announcement.

**Decision** — ArrowUp/ArrowDown both fall through to `0` when no card is focused yet — first ArrowDown grabs the top card. Same UX as the gallery's keyboard nav.

**Decision** — letter shortcuts fire only when a card is focused. ArrowUp/ArrowDown don't require focus (they grab focus instead).

**Evidence**: tsc clean across both files.

### T028 — Settings registration via SDK contribution manifest

**Plan deviation**: original plan said "cross-domain drop-in at `_platform/settings/sections/recent-feed-settings.tsx`". The actual codebase uses Plan 047's USDK contribution-manifest pattern — settings are declared in each domain's `sdk/contribution.ts` and the SettingsPage queries `sdk.settings.list()` to render them. There is no `_platform/settings/sections/` directory. NO cross-domain modification needed; settings are added to file-browser's own contribution.

Two files:

**`recent-feed-settings.defaults.ts`** (NEW) — single source of truth:
- `RECENT_FEED_SETTING_KEYS` const map (10 entries, all under `fileBrowser.recentFeed.*` namespace — Constitution Gate locked).
- `RecentFeedSettings` interface.
- `RECENT_FEED_DEFAULTS` typed constant: feedSize=50, feedCeiling=200, defaultFilters=['all'], mdExcerptLines=8, mdExcerptChars=600, codeExcerptLines=12, autoplayPolicy='off', deletedWindow=5000, inFlightMediaBound=5, openOnLaunch=false. Workshop §9 binding.
- AutoplayPolicy + FilterDefault types.

**`sdk/contribution.ts`** — appended 8 entries to `settings: [...]` array under section `Recent Changes Feed`. Each entry sources its default from `RECENT_FEED_DEFAULTS.<key>` so defaults can NEVER drift between contribution + orchestrator. Schema uses Zod ranges (e.g., `z.number().int().min(5).max(200).default(...)`) — bounds are sanity guards, not policy.

UI types: `number` for numeric settings (feedSize, feedCeiling, excerpt limits, deletedWindow, inFlightMediaBound), `select` for autoplayPolicy (off / on-hover / on with loop), `toggle` for openOnLaunch. SettingsPage's `SettingControl` renders each.

**Decision** — `defaultFilters` (string-array shape) has no UI control yet — Plan 047 USDK's SettingControl renders number/toggle/select/string but not multi-select. Documented as a v1.x candidate in the contribution comment. Orchestrator reads the default for first-render.

**Decision** — schema bounds are sanity guards only. e.g., feedSize min=5 max=200 — going below 5 makes the seed pointless; going above 200 OOMs the browser per Finding 05. T028 sets those bounds in a single place.

**Decision** — Constitution Gate row `fileBrowser.recentFeed.*` LOCKED is now load-bearing: future renames require a migration step in this commit's lineage. The defaults file is the canonical key registry.

**Evidence**: tsc clean for both files. The settings appear in the existing settings page under section "Recent Changes Feed" the next time the SettingsPage is rendered (no extra wiring needed — `sdk.settings.list()` returns the new entries via the contribution registration).

### T029-T031 — Entrypoints (button + USDK + open-on-launch)

Three concurrent entrypoints (AC A2 binding) wired in browser-client.tsx + sdk/contribution.ts:

**T029 — top-bar button**: rendered via the existing `rightActions` slot ExplorerPanel publishes (currently used by `QuestionPopperIndicator`). History icon, `aria-label="Open Recent Changes Feed"`, click sets `?view=recent-feed` via `setParams`. **Plan deviation**: avoided modifying `_platform/panel-layout/components/explorer-panel.tsx` — the slot was already there. Net: ZERO cross-domain modifications for this task. Plan task row updated.

**T030 — USDK command + keybinding**:
- Manifest entry in `sdk/contribution.ts`: `{ id: 'file-browser.openRecentFeed', title: 'Open Recent Changes Feed', icon: 'history', params: z.object({}) }`. Constitution Gate command-name LOCK satisfied.
- Keybinding `$mod+Shift+KeyU` (Updates) — Finding 09 conflict check: only existing `$mod+Shift+...` keybindings are pr-view's `KeyR` and notes' `KeyL`. `KeyU` is conflict-free; `KeyR`/`KeyF` would have collided with browser reload/find.
- Handler registered in `browser-client.tsx` alongside the existing palette/goToFile/openFileAtLine/restartFlowspace handlers, with a closure over the live `setParams`. Disposed on unmount.

**T031 — open-on-launch routing**: one-shot `useEffect` keyed on `(slug, worktreePath)`:
- Skips if `params.view` is already set (user just navigated in).
- Skips if `params.file` or `params.dir` is set (user wanted a specific file/dir).
- Reads `sdk.settings.get('fileBrowser.recentFeed.openOnLaunch')`; if `true`, sets `?view=recent-feed` with `history: 'replace'` (so back-button takes the user out of the workspace, not back to the implicit landing without the feed).

**Decision** — open-on-launch is non-reactive on purpose. Toggling the setting from inside an active workspace doesn't immediately open the feed (the user explicitly didn't open it). The setting takes effect on next workspace landing. Less surprising behavior, smaller blast radius.

**Decision** — `sdk.settings.get` doesn't accept a generic; cast at the call site to `boolean | undefined`. Same pattern `useSDKSetting` uses internally (`as T`).

**Evidence**: tsc clean (only pre-existing TS2339 at lines 517-518 — `fileNav.fileData?.content` — same as before).

### T032-T034 — Documentation

**T032 — `docs/domains/file-browser/domain.md`**:
- New `Recent changes feed` Concept row added under § Concepts. Entry points listed: `RecentFeedView`, `useRecentFeedState`, `getRecentFeedItems`, `getFileExcerpt`. Description captures workshop-binding details (workshop §1-§9, Findings 01/04/05/14).
- History row appended summarising all T001-T031 deliverables: orchestrator + reducer + service + 9-action hook + virtualization + 10 LOCKED settings + 3 entrypoints + USDK cmd + keybinding + 90+ tests + Constitution P4 honor.

**T033 — `docs/how/recent-changes-feed.md`** (NEW):
- 4 entrypoints (button / keybinding / palette / open-on-launch)
- Card anatomy ASCII + per-type preview matrix
- Action shortcuts table + full 9-action catalog reference
- Filter chip semantics (workshop §5)
- Pause + buffer pill behavior
- All 10 settings with defaults + purpose
- USDK command reference
- 5 troubleshooting scenarios: non-git seed, SSE disconnect, mass-rename burst, build-artifact noise, forbidden excerpt, Shiki cold-start
- v2 out-of-scope catalog

**T034 — top-level `README.md`**:
- Added a `## File Browser Features` section between `## Project Structure` and `## Agent System`. One paragraph describing the feed + link to `docs/how/recent-changes-feed.md`.

**Decision** — README pointer placement: chose between `apps/web/README.md` (doesn't exist) and top-level `README.md`. Top-level is the user-facing entry; that's where discovery happens.

**Evidence**: documentation files only — no code changes; tsc unaffected.

## Per-Task Entries

### T001 — Create recent-feed/ scaffold + types

Created two files:
- `apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/components/recent-feed/types.ts` — `FeedItem`, `FeedItemKind` (image|video|audio|markdown|code|binary|generic), `FeedEventType` (added|changed|deleted), `FeedState` (items + paused + buffer + ceiling + isLoading + isError + errorMessage + isDisconnected + dismissed:Set).
- `apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/components/recent-feed/index.ts` — re-exports the four type aliases. Component re-exports empty per plan ("barrel exports empty").

**Decision**: `FeedItemKind` adds `markdown` / `code` / `generic` on top of `detectContentType`'s categories (`image|video|audio|html|pdf|binary`). The feed needs to distinguish text-based excerpt cards from generic binaries; mapping happens in T012's seed wiring.

**Decision**: `dismissed: Set<string>` lives in state, not a separate hook — keeps T025 `dismiss` action a single dispatch and avoids cross-component refs.

**Evidence**: `tsc --noEmit` shows zero errors in `recent-feed/` (pre-existing errors in unrelated `browser-client.tsx`, `useAgentInstance.ts`, `mobile-search-overlay.tsx`, `flowspace-mcp-client.ts`, `workflow-execution-manager.ts` — not mine).

### T002 — Add view enum to fileBrowserParams

Added `view: parseAsStringLiteral(['recent-feed'] as const)` to `fileBrowserParams`. Result type is `'recent-feed' | null` — nuqs's literal parser cannot accept `null` as a withDefault argument (the default must be one of the literal values), so the plan's `.withDefault(null)` shorthand was implemented as "no withDefault" to get the same nullable behavior. Existing 5 params (dir, file, mode, panel, line) unchanged.

**Plan note**: Updated plan task row to document the API correction.

**Evidence**: typecheck clean for `file-browser.params.ts`; the param flows through `fileBrowserPageParamsCache` automatically (spread).

### T003 — Add view branch in browser-client.tsx

Created stub `recent-feed-view.tsx` with `RecentFeedView({ slug, worktreePath, isGit, onClose })` exporting a placeholder loading message. T012 will replace the body with the seeded orchestrator. Stub keeps the import path resolved during incremental landing.

In `browser-client.tsx`:
- Added `import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'`.
- Added module-scope `const RecentFeedView = dynamic(() => import(...).then(m => m.RecentFeedView), { ssr: false, loading: ... })` for code-splitting.
- Pulled `view` from `params` (alongside `mode`, `selectedFile`, `currentDir`, `panelMode`, `scrollToLine`).
- Added `handleCloseRecentFeed` callback that sets `view: null` via `setParams` (history: 'push'), restoring prior `selectedFile`/`currentDir` state per Finding 07.
- Added `view === 'recent-feed' ?` branch BEFORE `selectedFile ?` in TWO render locations:
  - `contentView` (mobile Content tab, line 892)
  - `main={...}` (desktop main slot, line 1141)

**Decision**: Did NOT extract the cascade into a helper component despite duplication — pre-existing code smell; refactoring it falls outside T003's scope (CLAUDE.md: "no premature abstraction; bug fix doesn't need surrounding cleanup"). The two locations differ in their `FolderPreviewPanel.onFileClick` handler (mobile sets `mobileActiveIndex(1)`), so the duplication is not 100% — extraction would need to thread that callback.

**Decision**: Stub component exports both default and named — keeps `next/dynamic` happy regardless of import style. T012 may consolidate to one when the orchestrator lands.

**Plan-spec deviation**: T012 normally builds `RecentFeedView` from scratch. This task creates a minimal stub now so the import resolves; T012 will replace the body in-place (no path change). Recorded here so the companion sees this as intentional.

**Evidence**: `tsc --noEmit` shows zero new errors. The two errors at lines 516-517 are pre-existing (`fileNav.fileData?.content` against `ReadFileResult` type) — exact same errors flagged before T003 at lines 492-493 (shifted by 24 because of the dynamic import + close handler addition).

### T004 — Lightweight test for view-branch routing invariant

Plan path was `test/unit/web/041-file-browser/...` but existing convention is `test/unit/web/features/041-file-browser/...`. Corrected the path; updated plan task row to record the correction.

Wrote `browser-client-view-branch.test.tsx` with 7 tests across two suites:

- **RecentFeedView stub** (2 tests): renders placeholder copy; does not invoke onClose during render.
- **browser-client.tsx routing — Finding 07 ordering invariant** (5 tests): asserts the `next/dynamic` import shape (with `ssr:false`); reads `view` from params destructure; defines `handleCloseRecentFeed` setting only `view: null` (preserving other params); `view === 'recent-feed'` precedes `selectedFile ? (` in the **mobile** contentView block; same ordering in the **desktop** main slot block.

**Decision** — testing strategy: BrowserClient composes ~25 hooks/contexts. Mocking those would either (a) violate Constitution P4 (no `vi.mock` of own-domain internals) or (b) drown the test in 150 lines of mock plumbing. Instead, this lightweight test verifies the two specific properties Finding 07 binds — the prop shape (smoke) and the source-level ordering (regex on the file). The actual end-to-end behavior is covered later by T013 (real git seed integration test) and T035 (harness visual smoke).

**Decision** — source-regex tests are normally fragile, but the ordering invariant *is* the test: if a future refactor swaps the cascade so `selectedFile ?` comes before `view ===`, the user's prior file/dir state is wiped on feed close. The regex is the cheapest enforcement mechanism for that invariant.

**Evidence**: `npx vitest run` passes 7/7 in 13ms.

### T005 — Extend CardActions with onCopyAbsolutePath, onOpen, overflowMenu

Three new optional props added to `CardActionsProps`:
- `onCopyAbsolutePath?: (path: string) => void` — renders a second copy button (FileText icon) when supplied. Tooltip on the existing copy button switches from "Copy path" → "Copy relative path" to disambiguate.
- `onOpen?: (path: string) => void` — renders a left-most "Open" button (ExternalLink icon) when supplied.
- `overflowMenu?: ReactNode` — caller-supplied overflow slot appended at the right (CardActions does not own the menu's content).

**Decision** — internal state shape: replaced the `copied: boolean` flag with `copiedKind: 'rel' | 'abs' | null` so both copy buttons can independently flash a confirmation tick. Keeps a single state variable instead of two.

**Decision** — button order: Open · Copy rel · Copy abs · Download · Overflow. Matches workshop §3's pinned action order for media cards.

**Decision** — tooltip relabel only when both copy buttons render. Existing 5 callers (image-card, video-card, audio-card, generic-card, folder-card) all supply only `onCopyPath` + `onDownload`, so they continue to show "Copy path" — zero UX change for the gallery.

5 existing callers verified via grep: `image-card.tsx:75`, `generic-card.tsx:62`, `video-card.tsx:117`, `audio-card.tsx:56`, `folder-card.tsx:47`. None pass `onCopyAbsolutePath`, `onOpen`, or `overflowMenu`, so all continue to render exactly the same 2-button strip.

**Evidence**: `tsc --noEmit` clean for `card-actions.tsx` and all preview-cards consumers.

### T006 — CardActions extension contract test

10 tests across 2 suites:

- **Plan 077 baseline (gallery cards)** — 4 tests: only Copy + Download render with the original prop set; Open / Copy abs / Copy relative path tooltips absent; onCopyPath fires with the exact path; onDownload fires with the exact path.
- **Plan recent-changes-feed T005 extensions** — 6 tests: Open button renders + fires onOpen; Copy abs button renders + fires onCopyAbsolutePath; tooltip on first copy switches to "Copy relative path" exactly when both copy actions are present (and original "Copy path" tooltip disappears); overflow ReactNode renders inline; full prop set produces all 5 buttons in correct order; Open click does not leak into other handlers.

**Decision** — used `toHaveBeenCalledExactlyOnceWith` which catches double-fire bugs that would slip past `toHaveBeenCalledWith`. The `e.stopPropagation()` calls in CardActions are critical (the cards are inside clickable feed-card shells in T007); these tests don't directly assert stopPropagation but the call-once assertions catch any regression that re-bubbles.

**Plan path correction** noted in plan task row.

**Evidence**: `npx vitest run` passes 10/10 in 92ms.

### T007 — feed-card.tsx shell

`<FeedCard>` shell renders:
- Header strip: `<FileIcon>` (from `_platform/themes` per Finding) · clickable filename (semibold, truncates) · path (muted, left-truncated via `dir="rtl"` + nested `<bdo dir="ltr">` so trailing segments stay visible) · meta line (relative time · size · event-type colored badge) · actions slot (top-right, hover-revealed via group-hover).
- Preview slot — `children` rendered below the header strip with subtle muted background.

**Decision** — left-truncation: used `dir="rtl"` + `<bdo dir="ltr">` to flip the truncation anchor without reversing reading order. Cleaner than CSS `direction: rtl` hacks that affect the entire layout subtree. Workshop §2 D1 specified "truncated from the left so trailing path segments stay visible".

**Decision** — `formatRelativeTime` and `formatFileSize` exported from feed-card.tsx (not split into a util file). Two reasons: (1) they have no other consumers yet, so a util file would be premature; (2) they're tested via the rendered card output. If T010 (header/filters) or T023 (deleted preview) needs the relative-time formatter, we promote it then. Avoids speculative abstraction (CLAUDE.md).

**Decision** — `role="article"` is set explicitly here (with biome `useSemanticElements` ignored for the `<article>` element rationale comment) so T027 (a11y pass) can wire `role="feed"` at the list level without re-traversing card markup. AC H1 satisfied at the shell level.

**Decision** — clickable title is a `<button>` not an anchor: the open action will dispatch a state transition (set `?file=...&view=null`) via `onActivate`, not navigate to an external URL. Matches the existing `image-card.tsx` `role="button"` pattern but uses a real button for proper keyboard semantics.

**Decision** — event badge uses semantic colors (green/blue/red) that work in both light and dark themes (T027 will verify contrast).

**Evidence**: `tsc --noEmit` clean for `feed-card.tsx`. Tests for the formatters + render assertions land at T035 (full-suite verification) — not gated here per plan's Done When ("Card renders with mock `FeedItem`" — render path verified by typecheck + visual harness in T035).

### T008 — Image / Video / Audio / Binary preview cards

Four sibling components under `recent-feed/previews/`. All slot into `<FeedCard>` as children:

- **ImagePreview**: `useLazyLoad` (no fork — Finding 14) + raw-file-API URL passed in by the orchestrator. Bounded `max-h-[60vh]`. Loaded/error fade-in.
- **VideoPreview**: native `<video controls preload="metadata">` with optional `posterUrl`. Workshop §6 NO autoplay-loop binding honored. `preload="metadata"` keeps memory bounded until user interacts (Finding 05). `useLazyLoad` defers element insertion until card scrolls into viewport.
- **AudioPreview**: native `<audio controls preload="metadata">`. No virtualization needed (audio elements are cheap until played).
- **BinaryPreview**: file icon + formatted size + the binding "Binary file — preview not available." copy (AC D3).

**Decision** — preview components take `rawFileUrl` directly (string) rather than computing it themselves. Centralizes URL construction in the orchestrator (T012) and keeps previews dumb. Same pattern as Plan 077 image-card.

**Decision** — biome `useMediaCaption` ignored on `<video>` and `<audio>` with rationale comment ("workspace-local user content; captions cannot be auto-derived"). Same call existing video-card and audio-card make — consistent with the codebase's a11y posture.

**Decision** — ImagePreview reserves a 32-row placeholder (`h-32`) before lazy-load fires, BinaryPreview is intrinsically sized. Video reserves 48-row placeholder. Keeps virtualization pre-fetch heights stable.

**Evidence**: `tsc --noEmit` clean for all 4 previews. Visual smoke at T035.

### T009-T011 — Static UI primitives (single commit, three plan rows)

Bundled as one logical commit because they're sibling primitives that together constitute "the static feed shell" — none stands alone usefully and they will land into the orchestrator (T012) as a unit.

**T009 — `recent-feed-list.tsx`** (virtualized vertical list):
- Strategy: `content-visibility: auto` + `contain-intrinsic-size: auto 480px` per item. Native browser virtualization, zero JS overhead.
- Decision: did NOT use `react-window` or measure row heights. Variable-height media cards make explicit virtualization more complex than `content-visibility:auto` + a one-time intrinsic-size hint. Idle entries release decoded media via the preview-level `useLazyLoad` (Finding 14). Covers AC G1, G2.
- Decision: `role="feed"` is set at the orchestrator (T012/T027), not the list itself. Keeps list a pure container.

**T010 — `recent-feed-header.tsx` + `recent-feed-filters.tsx`** (chrome strip + chip row):
- Header: title · live indicator (green pulsing dot when live + not paused; muted otherwise) · counter · pause/resume button · refresh · settings cog. `aria-live="polite"` on the live indicator so SR users hear pause/resume transitions. Workshop §5 chrome.
- Filters: 7 chips (All, Images, Videos, Audio, Markdown, Code, Other). Multi-select via `aria-pressed`. Component is a dumb chip strip — set-management semantics (auto-snap-to-all when last chip removed) live in T015 reducer + T024 predicate test.
- Decision: `FilterCategory` exported as a discriminated string union for downstream use in T015's reducer. `FILTER_CATEGORIES` is the canonical ordered list — keeps the chip order deterministic for snapshot tests.

**T011 — `feed-empty-state.tsx` + `feed-error-state.tsx` + `feed-skeleton.tsx`** (state placeholders):
- `FeedSkeleton`: stacks 5 `<CardSkeleton>` (Plan 077 — Finding 13 anti-reinvention). Vertical with stagger animation; matches the feed's actual layout.
- `FeedEmptyState`: two copy variants based on `filtered` prop — generic "no recent changes" vs filter-specific "no matches; try All".
- `FeedErrorState`: amber AlertCircle + main message + optional detail (e.g., "not a git workspace") + invariant clarification "Live file changes will still appear here as they happen" (per AC B3 — live updates still functional during seed failure). Optional `onRetry`.

**Evidence**: `tsc --noEmit` clean across all 5 new files (recent-feed-list, recent-feed-header, recent-feed-filters, feed-empty-state, feed-error-state, feed-skeleton).
