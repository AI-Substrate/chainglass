## T000 — Pre-implement harness seam

**Event**: `/eng-harness-flow --event pre-implement --phase "Phase 2: Domain, Protocol & Session Core (TDD)" --plan-dir docs/plans/088-remote-app-view --prompt-optional=false`
**Outcome**: Router installed (`~/.agents/skills/eng-harness-flow/SKILL.md` present) but this repo has **no `.harness/`** — the seam routes to adoption and **noops** (verdict equivalent to `UNAVAILABLE`). Standard vitest testing applies (`fileParallelism:false`, jsdom for `**/web/**`). No blocker; recorded once, not re-warned.

## T001 — Domain setup + feature dir ✅

**Created**:
- `docs/domains/remote-view/domain.md` — Purpose, Owns/Excludes (from spec sketch), §Concepts (ADR-0011: Wire Protocol, Frame-Replay Fake, Viewport Machine, Session, Token Route), Dependencies (per-phase wiring), Source Location, History.
- `apps/web/src/features/088-remote-view/{protocol/fixtures/video,server,hooks,testing,params,sdk,components}` — feature skeleton (`.gitkeep` in the three Phase-2-empty dirs: params/sdk/components).
- `apps/web/app/api/remote-view/token/` dir (route lands in T008); `test/unit/web/features/088-remote-view/` test dir.

**Edited (additive only)**:
- `docs/domains/registry.md` — row `| Remote View | remote-view | business | — | Plan 088 | active |`.
- `docs/domains/domain-map.md` — `remoteView` node + dependency edges (auth wired Phase 2; events/state/sdk/panel-layout designed) + Health Summary row.

**Notes**: No `_platform` source touched (T002 guard makes that permanent). No TS yet → typecheck/lint unaffected. Progress cadence for this phase: task-table checkbox + this log updated per task (the user-watched surfaces); the tasks.md Architecture Map node colours are flipped in one pass at phase end.
