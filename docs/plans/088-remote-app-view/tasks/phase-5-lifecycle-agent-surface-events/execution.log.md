# Phase 5 — Execution Log

**Plan**: [`../../remote-app-view-plan.md`](../../remote-app-view-plan.md)
**Phase**: Phase 5 — Lifecycle, Agent Surface & Events
**Companion**: `code-review-companion` run `2026-06-21T08-27-24-946Z-f514` (Power-On mode, reviews every commit)

## T001 — daemon-manager (spawn / poll / version handshake) ✅

**Tests**: `test/unit/web/features/088-remote-view/daemon-manager.test.ts` — **7/7 green**
**Files**: `apps/web/src/features/088-remote-view/server/daemon-manager.ts` (+ test)

TDD RED→GREEN. `createDaemonManager(config, deps)` exposes `ensureDaemon()`:

- **spawn-on-demand** — inner binary, detached, absolute `--port`/`--registry`/`--bootstrap` argv (daemon never computes the offset);
- **readiness poll** — registry file appears **then** `GET /health` ok, bounded by `readinessTimeoutMs` (5s default);
- **version handshake** — reuse a healthy + protocol-matched daemon; respawn a crashed one (no graceful shutdown — it's already dead); on a protocol mismatch send `POST /shutdown` then respawn; if still mismatched after respawn throw an actionable `just streamd-install` error;
- **read-not-derive** — `daemonPort` is read from the registry `port` field (a test pins a registry port ≠ `webPort+1501` to prove it).

I/O is injected (`spawnDaemon` / `fetchHealth` / `shutdownDaemon` / `sleep` / `now`), so the whole lifecycle is unit-tested deterministically against a temp registry dir — no live daemon.

**Evidence (7 tests)**: spawn-on-demand + read-port · reuse-healthy (0 spawns) · crashed-respawn (0 shutdowns) · version-mismatch graceful-respawn (`shutdown` then respawn) · stale-install error · readiness-timeout · `CG_REMOTE_VIEW__DAEMON_PORT` override.

**Decision logged** (Discoveries): spawn the **inner binary directly** (spike §1.5b: TCC keys on bundle-id+cert, path-independent) rather than Workshop 004's `open -a <bundle>`; behind an injectable spawner. **Phase 6 must verify** the TCC grant persists live across this spawn path.

**Exposes** `ensureDaemon()` for the T004/T005 proxy routes to call before proxying.

## T002 — fail-closed daemon reaper ✅

**Tests**: `test/unit/web/features/088-remote-view/daemon-reaper.test.ts` — **7/7 green**
**Files**: `apps/web/src/features/088-remote-view/server/daemon-reaper.ts` (+ test)

TDD. `reapStreamdDaemon(root, webPort, deps)` mirrors `pty-registry.ts` semantics (copied, not imported — cross-domain). Kill gate is **fail-closed**: SIGTERM only a pid that is alive (`kill(pid,0)`, EPERM⇒alive) **AND** verifiably ours — the `ps -o command= -p` EXECUTABLE (first argv token) is exactly the signed inner binary `<bundlePath>/Contents/MacOS/streamd` (not a mere substring match). Outcomes: orphan (alive+ours) → graceful SIGTERM + delete registry; dead → delete stale entry, no signal; alive-but-mismatched (recycled pid) or unprobeable → **never signal**, leave the file. Per-webPort only, so concurrent worktree daemons never reap each other (Workshop 004 Q2).

**Evidence (7 tests)**: orphan reaped (SIGTERM + cleaned) · dead entry cleaned (no kill) · recycled-pid never killed · probe-failure never kills · no-registry no-op · `isProcessAlive` EPERM/ESRCH · `isStreamdProcess` match/reject/fail-closed.

**Decision logged** (Discoveries): corrected Workshop 004's "alive-but-mismatched → kill" to the fail-closed dossier/pty-registry rule (never kill a pid we can't prove is ours).

**Deferred** (Discoveries): the reaper isn't yet *called* at web-server boot — wire `reapStreamdDaemon` into the startup path at the first integration point (Phase-end rollup will surface this).

## Companion review loop — T001 + T002 (REQUEST_CHANGES → fixed)

`code-review-companion` returned **REQUEST_CHANGES** on both commits; all four findings fixed in one loop before T003:

| ID | Sev | Finding | Resolution |
|----|-----|---------|------------|
| F001 | HIGH | Respawn `pollUntilHealthy` returned the first `/health`-ok daemon regardless of protocol → the old daemon still gracefully exiting with the stale version could trigger a false `stale-install` error. | Respawn now polls for a **version-matched** health (`pollUntilHealthy(accept = versionOk)`); only after the full readiness window with no match does it diagnose stale-install vs readiness-timeout. Regression added (health lingers v99 then → v1). |
| F004 | HIGH | Reaper `isStreamdProcess` used `cmd.includes(bundlePath)` → a recycled pid whose **argv** merely mentioned the path (e.g. `python3 …/streamd`) could be SIGTERM'd — a fail-closed hole. | Now matches the **executable** (first argv token): `cmd === innerBinary || cmd.startsWith(innerBinary + ' ')`. Regression rejects `/usr/bin/python3 <innerBinary>`. |
| F002 | MED | `DaemonHealth.permissions.screenRecording` was `boolean`; the Phase 4 daemon returns the grant-string union for **both** permissions. | Changed to `PermissionGrant = 'granted' \| 'denied' \| 'not-determined'` for both; test fake updated — locks the frozen `/health` shape before T004 proxies it. |
| F003 | MED | Active Phase 5 task row + diagrams + plan row still said `open -g`, contradicting the inner-binary spawn decision. | Updated the T001 row, spawn-lifecycle + sequence diagrams, and plan 5.1 to "detached signed inner binary"; spike/Workshop refs left as superseded history. |
| F005 | MED | Re-review found residual reaper-contract drift: plan said `else kill+clean`, Workshop 004 still said `alive-but-mismatched → kill`, and this log described the old `contains bundlePath + streamd token` predicate. | Plan row now states mismatched/unprobeable pids are left alone; Workshop 004's old rule marked **[SUPERSEDED by T002]**; this log's predicate corrected to exact inner-binary executable match. |

**Re-review verdict (commit `f90104a6`)**: `code-review-companion` → **APPROVE_WITH_NOTES** — F001/F002/F004 closed in code+tests, F003 mostly closed; only F005 (doc drift) remained, now fixed. Tests after fixes: **16/16 green** (8 manager + 8 reaper).

**Companion lifecycle note**: the run idle-timed-out ("session idle / stopped for idle budget") during the post-checkpoint wait — the known structural gap (a companion booted for a phase with human-in-the-loop gaps dies in the gaps). Its findings + magicWand (state-vocabulary schema mismatch) are preserved under `agents/code-review-companion/runs/2026-06-21T08-27-24-946Z-f514/`. Remaining tasks (T003+) need a fresh `minih run` or a post-hoc review pass.
