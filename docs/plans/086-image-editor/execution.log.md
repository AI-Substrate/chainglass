# Execution Log — Plan 086 In-browser Image Editor (Simple, single phase)

**Implementer**: `/plan-6-v2-implement-phase-companion`
**Companion**: `code-review-companion` (minih) — run `2026-06-08T07-32-46-663Z-5da5`
**Started**: 2026-06-08
**Branch**: `084-random-enhancements-3` (shared random-enhancements branch; Plan 085 also landed here)

## Pre-Phase Agent Harness Validation

Governance: `docs/project-rules/harness.md` (browser-capable; Playwright + CDP→Chromium).

| Stage | Check | Result | Detail |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| Boot | `just harness-health` | ✅ HEALTHY | app up (200), mcp up (406), terminal up |
| Interact | CDP reachable | ✅ | cdp up — Chrome/136.0.7103.25 |
| Observe | console/screenshot via harness CLI | ✅ available | `just harness check-route/screenshot/console-logs` |

**Verdict**: ✅ HEALTHY — the browser sensor (T016) can genuinely run. Dev app already serving on :3000.

## Reuse Anchors Verified (in this worktree, before coding)

| Anchor | Path | Use |
|--------|------|-----|
| `uploadFileService` | `apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/services/upload-file.ts` | Buffer + atomic tmp→rename precedent for `saveImageService` |
| `saveFileAction` (service) | `apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/services/file-actions.ts` | mtime-conflict (`expectedMtime && !force` → `serverMtime`); `SaveFileResult` shape |
| Secure slug→worktree | `apps/web/app/actions/file-actions.ts` (`fileExists`/`pathExists`) | `workspaceService.getInfo(slug)` → trusted root + realpath containment |
| `detectContentType` | `apps/web/src/lib/content-type-detection.ts` | raster predicate (`category==='image'`) |
| DI | `getContainer()` + `SHARED_DI_TOKENS.FILESYSTEM/PATH_RESOLVER`, `WORKSPACE_DI_TOKENS.WORKSPACE_SERVICE` | server action wiring |
| Fakes | `@chainglass/shared` re-exports `FakeFileSystem`/`FakePathResolver` | unit tests (no `vi.mock`) |
| Lazy/toolbar precedent | `apps/web/src/features/_platform/viewer/components/markdown-wysiwyg-editor{,-lazy}.tsx`, `wysiwyg-toolbar.tsx` | T009/T010 patterns |
| Smoke precedent | `harness/tests/smoke/markdown-wysiwyg-smoke.spec.ts` | T016 |

**Refinement logged**: the plan's shorthand Edit predicate `category==='image' && ext!=='svg'` would also admit `ico/avif/bmp` (all `category==='image'` in `content-type-detection.ts`). AC-16 + T005 enumerate the explicit raster set `{png,jpg,jpeg,gif,webp}`. Resolution: `image-filename.ts` exports `RASTER_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` + `isRasterImageFilename()`; both the affordance (T013) and the action (T005) intersect `category==='image'` with that explicit set. Matches AC-16 precisely.

## Task Log

<!-- per-task entries appended below as they land -->

### T001 + T002 — `image-filename` helper (TDD) ✅

- **RED**: wrote `test/unit/web/features/086-image-editor/image-filename.test.ts` (11 tests) — failed on missing module.
- **GREEN**: implemented `apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/services/image-filename.ts` — `deriveEditedFilename` (idempotent `-edited`, dir-preserving, GIF→PNG), `outputFormatForImage` (PNG/WebP lossless+alpha; JPEG q0.92+flatten; GIF→PNG), `isRasterImageFilename` + `RASTER_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`.
- **Evidence**: `vitest run image-filename.test.ts` → 11 passed.
- **Decision**: explicit raster allow-list (not just `category==='image'`) so `ico/avif/bmp` are excluded per AC-16. Covers AC-5, AC-6 (incl. finding 09 GIF→PNG).
- **Commit**: `665ab108` · 📡 companion pinged.

### T003 + T004 — `saveImageService` (TDD) ✅

- **RED**: `test/unit/web/features/086-image-editor/save-image.test.ts` (7 tests) — failed on missing module.
- **GREEN**: `apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/services/save-image.ts` — Buffer write, atomic tmp→rename, mtime-conflict (overwrite + `expectedMtime` only → `serverMtime`), edited-copy unconditional, `security`/`write-failed` typed results. Modelled on `upload-file.ts` + `saveFileAction`.
- **Evidence**: 7 passed. Buffer round-trip verified (`getFile(ABS)` deep-equals input bytes); `.tmp` cleaned via rename; conflict leaves original bytes untouched.
- **Decision**: dropped the `force` flag from the contract — "overwrite anyway" is simply omitting `expectedMtime` (simpler than `saveFileAction`'s `force`). Covers AC-3, AC-4, AC-8, AC-9, AC-13.
- **Commit**: `b8e656bd` · 📡 companion pinged.

### T005 + T006 — `saveEditedImage` action + `perfect-freehand` dep ✅

- **T005**: `apps/web/app/actions/image-actions.ts` (`'use server'`) — `requireAuth`, server-side raster gate (`isRasterImageFilename` → `unsupported-type`), DI via `getContainer()`, trusted root from `workspaceService.getInfo(slug)`, server-owned naming (`deriveEditedFilename` for edited-copy), base64→Buffer, delegate to `saveImageService`. `SaveEditedImageResult` extends the service union with `unsupported-type`.
- **Decision**: binary payload crosses the action boundary as **base64 string** (decoded to Buffer server-side) — universally serializable, testable. Naming derivation lives server-side (single source of truth); client sends original `filePath` + `mode`.
- **T006**: `perfect-freehand@^1.2.3` added to `@chainglass/web` deps (lazy-chunk only).
- **Evidence**: `tsc --noEmit -p apps/web` → no errors in new files; dep present in `package.json`.
- **Commit**: `58b9f21c` · 📡 companion pinged. **Task group "Save backend" complete.**

### T007 + T008 — `canvas-coords` + `image-export` pure helpers (TDD) ✅

- **RED**: `canvas-coords.test.ts` (4) + `image-export.test.ts` (7) — failed on missing modules.
- **GREEN**: `viewer/lib/canvas-coords.ts` (`cssToImagePoint` — object-contain scale+offset+clamp) and `viewer/lib/image-export.ts` (`canvasExportFormat`, `exceedsCanvasLimit`, `MAX_CANVAS_DIMENSION=4096`, `MAX_CANVAS_AREA=16_777_216`).
- **Boundary decision**: viewer's `canvasExportFormat` (encoding) is deliberately separate from file-browser's `outputFormatForImage` (naming) so the viewer never imports file-browser (T019/G3). Shared GIF→PNG fact duplicated by design; documented in both files.
- **Evidence**: 11 passed.
- **Commit**: `602ee52b` · 📡 companion pinged.

### T009 + T010 + T011 — ImageEditor + toolbar + lazy + barrel + error/load states ✅

- **T009** `viewer/components/image-editor.tsx`: single canvas at intrinsic res; Pointer Events + `setPointerCapture` + `getCoalescedEvents`; `perfect-freehand` `getStroke`→Path2D→fill (`simulatePressure:false`, pressure `e.pressure || 0.5`); image-space stroke array + **undo** (no redo); `touch-action:none`; captures `imageMtime` (prop) → passed to `onSaveOver`; `data-testid` affordances for T016.
- **T010** `image-editor-toolbar.tsx` (pen color presets + 3 widths + Undo + Save over/Save as new/Cancel), `image-editor-lazy.tsx` (`dynamic ssr:false`, type-only props import so the chunk stays lazy), barrel exports `ImageEditorLazy` + `ImageEditorProps` + `ImageSaveOutcome`.
- **T011** error boundary (mirrors `EditorErrorBoundary`) + **load-failure** state (decode/0-dim/oversize → error UI, Save disabled, no canvas) + **export-failure** surfacing (`toBlob` `SecurityError`/null → inline error, strokes retained).
- **Boundary**: save flows DOWN as `onSaveOver`/`onSaveAsNew`/`onCancel` callbacks returning a viewer-owned `ImageSaveOutcome`; the conflict dialog lives in the parent (file-browser, T015) — the editor only reports the terminal outcome. Viewer imports nothing from file-browser. ✅
- **DI seam**: `saveImpl?(canvas, format) → base64` overrides the real `toBlob` exporter (jsdom has no `toBlob`).
- **Evidence**: `tsc --noEmit -p apps/web` → **0 errors in any image-editor file**. (Runtime/visual proof deferred to T016 browser smoke + manual.)

> **Discovery (pre-existing debt, NOT this plan)**: `apps/web` has **12 pre-existing `tsc` errors** in unrelated files — `app/(dashboard)/workspaces/[slug]/browser/browser-client.tsx` (ReadFileResult.content), `useAgentInstance.ts`, `workflow-execution-manager.ts`, `mobile-search-overlay.tsx`, `flowspace-mcp-client.ts`. None are in Plan-086 files. Flagged because they could affect the T017 `just build` gate (will assess at T017). Note: the route-level `(dashboard)/.../browser/browser-client.tsx` is **distinct** from the Domain-Manifest target `features/041-file-browser/components/browser-client.tsx` — T014/T015 must target the right file.

- **Commit**: `b6bcb378` · 📡 companion pinged. **Task group "Canvas helpers + editor" complete.**






### T012 — Binary round-trip integration test ✅

- `test/integration/web/image-editor-save.test.ts` (3 tests): builds a real PNG (signature + IHDR + IEND with valid CRC32), saves via `deriveEditedFilename`→`saveImageService` (the action's composition), reads back → **byte-identical** Buffer, valid PNG signature, IHDR dims preserved (120×80). Plus: edited-copy replaces existing sibling despite stale mtime; overwrite vs edited-copy path selection.
- **Note**: "decodable" = PNG signature + parseable IHDR (no pixel-decoder lib in the unit env; honest scope). Byte-equality is the real binary-fidelity proof. Covers AC-7, AC-9, AC-4.
- **Commit**: `002475ca` · 📡 companion pinged.

### T013 + T014 + T015 — Edit affordance + inline toggle + save UX wiring ✅

- **T013/T014** `file-viewer-panel.tsx` (`BinaryFileView`): raster-only **Edit** button (`category==='image' && isRasterImageFilename && onSaveImage` present); pre-measures natural size via a probe `Image` → **disables Edit with a message when oversized** (AC-14); Edit toggles the view area into `ImageEditorLazy` in place; success busts the `<img>` cache key.
- **T015** route `browser-client.tsx`: `handleSaveImage(payload, mode, expectedMtime)` → `saveEditedImage` action → on ok `handleRefreshFile()`; relays typed `{ok}|{ok:false,error}` (incl. `conflict`) back to the editor. Wired `onSaveImage` into BOTH FileViewerPanel render sites.
- **Evidence**: `tsc -p apps/web` → **0 new errors** (total stays 12 pre-existing); 32/32 086 unit+integration tests green. Runtime proof = T016 browser smoke + manual.

> **Deviation D1 (plan-vs-reality)**: the Domain Manifest named `apps/web/src/features/041-file-browser/components/browser-client.tsx` — **that file does not exist**. The real owner of `FileViewerPanel` + save wiring is the route `apps/web/app/(dashboard)/workspaces/[slug]/browser/browser-client.tsx`. Wired there instead. (That file also carries 2 of the 12 pre-existing `ReadFileResult.content` tsc errors — untouched by this work.)

> **Deviation D2 (conflict-dialog placement)**: plan T015 put the 3-way conflict dialog (Reload/Save-as-new/Overwrite-anyway) in browser-client. I placed it in the **editor (viewer)** instead — the editor holds the exported bytes + strokes, so it can re-issue overwrite-anyway / save-as-new without re-plumbing bytes through the parent, and it keeps the viewer↛file-browser boundary clean (the editor only calls its existing callbacks differently). browser-client stays a thin action+refresh relay. Functionally equivalent to AC-3.

### T016 — Playwright + CDP browser smoke ✅ (the runtime sensor)

- `harness/tests/smoke/image-editor-smoke.spec.ts`: writes a real (zlib-IDAT) PNG to the seeded workspace, opens it, dismisses the bootstrap gate, clicks **Edit**, asserts the canvas editor mounts (no `ssr:false` break), draws via pointer events, **Save as new → `sample-image-edited.png` appears on disk**, asserts **no `SecurityError`** (AC-17), editor exits on success, Cancel returns to view (AC-11).
- **Result**: ✅ **desktop + tablet PASS**, mobile skipped (out of scope). End-to-end proof of the whole stack: lazy editor (finding 03), pen, canvas export/CORS (AC-17), the `saveEditedImage` action + DI + **slug→`getInfo` trusted-root** + Buffer `saveImageService` + `deriveEditedFilename` — all verified in a real browser.
- **Run command**: `cd harness && npx playwright test tests/smoke/image-editor-smoke.spec.ts` (a.k.a. `just playwright`). **Done-when correction**: the plan said `just test-harness`, but that runs *vitest*; Playwright `.spec.ts` smokes run via `just playwright`.

> **Discovery (harness gotcha, HIGH value)**: the dev container uses a **named volume `cg_node_modules`** separate from the host. A host `pnpm add` does NOT reach it → the route 500'd with `Module not found: 'perfect-freehand'`. Fix: `docker exec chainglass-<worktree> sh -lc "cd /app && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile"` after adding a dep. Any future plan adding a dependency must re-install inside the container before the browser sensor will pass.
> **Discovery**: harness app port is slot-derived (this worktree = `:3107`, cdp `:9229`); get it via `cd harness && pnpm exec tsx src/cli/index.ts ports`. Workspaces are gated by a bootstrap code (`.chainglass/bootstrap-code.json`) — dismiss via `[data-testid="bootstrap-popup"]` (pattern from single-xterm smoke).

- **Commit**: `79cdc293` · 📡 companion pinged.

### T017 — AC-10 bundle guard ✅

- `pnpm turbo build --filter=@chainglass/web` → **success** (`cache miss, executing`; fresh build; `ignoreBuildErrors:true` so the 12 pre-existing tsc errors don't block).
- `test/unit/web/features/086-image-editor/bundle-ac10.test.ts`: sentinel `image-editor-canvas` (lives only in the heavy `image-editor.tsx`) appears in exactly **2 lazy chunks** and in **0** of the 8 shared `rootMainFiles` → editor confirmed out of the initial/shared bundle. **Manifest note**: Next 16 turbopack emits `build-manifest.json` (not `app-build-manifest.json`); test uses the former. Skips gracefully when `.next` is absent so `just test` stays green without a build.

### T018 — Docs + domain refresh ✅

- `docs/how/image-editor.md` — user guide (sibling to `markdown-wysiwyg.md`).
- `docs/domains/_platform/viewer/domain.md` — Contracts (`ImageEditorLazy`/`ImageEditorProps`/`ImageSaveOutcome`/`canvasExportFormat`/`exceedsCanvasLimit`) + History row.
- `docs/domains/file-browser/domain.md` — Contracts (`saveEditedImage`/`saveImageService`/`deriveEditedFilename`/`isRasterImageFilename`) + Composition rows + History row.

### T019 — Dependency-direction guard ✅

- `test/unit/web/architecture/viewer-no-file-browser.test.ts`: scans every viewer source; asserts **zero** imports of `041-file-browser`. Green. Closes the one genuinely-ABSENT sensor from the backpressure survey (G3 / viewer↛file-browser).

**Task group "Sensors + docs" complete. All 19 tasks done. Full suite: 34 vitest tests + Playwright smoke (desktop+tablet) green; production build succeeds.**

## Companion Review — Findings Reconciliation (code-review-companion, run 2026-06-08T07-32-46-663Z-5da5)

The live companion raised **13 findings** across the phase. Reconciliation:

| ID | Sev | Finding | Disposition |
|----|-----|---------|-------------|
| F001 | MED | `outputFormatForImage` falls open to PNG for unsupported ext | **Mitigated** — both the affordance (T013) and the action (T005) gate on `isRasterImageFilename` before any derivation; `isRasterImageFilename` rejection is unit-tested. Fail-open path unreachable; no code change. |
| F002 | MED | stat failures during conflict check silently bypass guard; final stat can throw | **Fixed** — only `FileSystemError ENOENT` is ignored (creation); other stat errors → `write-failed`; final stat wrapped. +2 tests. |
| F003 | HIGH | invalid `mode` bypasses overwrite guard at the server boundary | **Fixed** — runtime `mode` validation in `saveEditedImage` before deriving target. |
| F004 | HIGH | unknown/tampered worktree path silently falls back to main root (security) | **Fixed** — fail-closed: reject unless the path matches a known worktree or `info.path`. |
| F005 | HIGH | editor carries strokes/state across image changes | **Fixed** — load effect resets strokes/loaded/error/conflict on `imageSrc` change. |
| F006 | HIGH | T012 PNG fixture has no IDAT → not decodable | **Fixed** — real zlib-IDAT PNG + `hasIdat` assertion. |
| F007 | MED | commits include `Co-Authored-By` AI attribution (forbidden by AGENTS.md:167) | **Acknowledged** — conflicts with the harness default trailer. Dropped the trailer on this fix commit onward; the 9 prior commits are flagged for squash-normalization at `/plan-8`. **Surfaced to user.** |
| F008 | HIGH | `editing`/`tooLarge` leak across files; edit branch ignores `canEdit` | **Fixed** — `BinaryFileView` keyed by `filePath` (remount) + edit branch requires `canEdit` + `probed` guard disables Edit until size measured. |
| F009 | HIGH | conflict "Reload" only discards, never reloads | **Fixed** — added `onReload` (cache-busts `imageSrc` → editor refetches + clears strokes) wired to the conflict Reload button. |
| F010 | MED | smoke fixture races across parallel projects | **Fixed** — per-project fixture/edited filenames; setup moved after the mobile skip. |
| F011 | HIGH | AC-10 guard checks only global shared chunks, overclaims route coverage | **Addressed** — claim made honest (global shared bundle + isolated lazy chunk); route-eager non-load is proven by the T016 runtime mount (canvas mounts only after Edit click). |
| F012 | MED | domain docs miss Concepts + Source Location for the editor | **Fixed** — added Image-Annotation concepts + source-file rows to both viewer and file-browser `domain.md`. |
| F013 | MED | T017-T019 commit (c65a27a3) swept in unrelated Plan 085 docs + retro | **Acknowledged** — git-add race; pre-existing branch WIP, collapses at squash-merge; this fix commit stages 086 files only. **Surfaced to user.** |

**Net**: 9 fixed in code (+ tests), 1 addressed by honest scoping, 3 acknowledged (2 are process/scope notes for the merge step). Post-fix: 36 vitest tests + Playwright smoke (desktop+tablet) green; 0 new tsc errors.

> **Note on commits**: per F007 + AGENTS.md, the `Co-Authored-By` trailer is dropped from this commit forward. The earlier commits carry it (harness default) — recommend normalizing at the squash-merge.

### Farewell-envelope findings (F014-F016, raised in the companion's final drain sweep)

| ID | Sev | Finding | Disposition |
|----|-----|---------|-------------|
| F014 | MED | ALL Plan 086 commits carry the AI-attribution trailer (extends F007) | **Acknowledged** — same as F007. The fix commit `c9c2acdf` onward drops it; earlier commits squash-normalize at `/plan-8`. |
| F015 | HIGH | completion docs marked phase/ACs complete while HIGH findings were still open | **Resolved (ordering lesson)** — valid critique: the fltplan/ACs were flipped to complete *before* the HIGH fixes landed. The HIGHs are now fixed (`c9c2acdf`) + re-verified (36 vitest + smoke green), so the completion markers are now accurate. Lesson logged in the retro: don't flip completion before the review loop closes. |
| F016 | MED | worktree dirty (generated `next-env.d.ts`, ephemeral `.chainglass` pids) | **Acknowledged** — those are build-generated / runtime-ephemeral, not Plan 086 artifacts (and predate this work); intentionally not committed. Recommend gitignoring them (separate housekeeping). |

**Final tally**: 16 findings (8 HIGH, 8 MEDIUM). Code-fixed: F002,F003,F004,F005,F006,F008,F009,F010 (8). Addressed by honest scoping/ordering: F011,F015. Mitigated-by-gate: F001. Process/handoff acknowledged for the merge step: F007,F012(done),F013,F014,F016. The companion's farewell envelope is at `agents/code-review-companion/runs/2026-06-08T07-32-46-663Z-5da5/output/report.json`.

> **Companion coordination note**: the companion stopped on `idle_budget` (its poll budget elapsed) just before my `control:stop` arrived — it had already completed its drain sweep and written the farewell, so nothing was lost. It also reported minih-runtime friction (state_transition schema errors, MINIH_* env vars absent in its shell) — captured as its magicWand for the harness.
